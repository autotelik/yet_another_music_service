# Shim to load environment variables from .env into ENV in development.
# We use dotenv to manage anything that is likely to change between deployment environments–such as resource handles
# for databases or credentials for external services

# Docker container probably requires diffrernt settings to non docker usage so
# a .env file presnet in this folder will be loaded into the container.
