          <h3>roadmap to micropayments</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">We are building a new hybrid, that takes the best concepts from current sharing sites, but builds in this key feature :<br><br>Implementation of direct micro payments for streaming, playlists and purchases. i.e artists get paid instantly, not at the whim of tech giants or their label. All payments will be purely crypto based, supporting tiny amounts, with minuscule fees. We are looking at the Lightning Network as probably the most promising technology in this area, in combination with Bitcoin and Litecoin.</p>
