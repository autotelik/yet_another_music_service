        YAMS is a new hybrid music site, built by musicians, for the benefit of artists and listeners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The end goal is to enable instantaneous micro payments, for streaming, playlists and purchases,
        combined with a content management system, giving artist's the ability to sign and manage ownership of their digital content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artists get paid instantly, not at the whim of tech giants or their music label.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consumers are not locked into monthly subscription fees but get total control over their spend.
      </p>
      <p>
        All payments would be purely crypto based, supporting tiny amounts, with minuscule fees,
        via the lightening network and combination of Bitcoin and/or Litecoin.

        <h5>Simplicity</h5>
        <p>
          We propose that current offerings actually suffer from over functionality.
          So we intend to remove (not implement) whole swathes of the features and functionality currently associated with existing,
          music discovery and streaming sites.
          The web offers the ability to pack sites full of features, and to make discovery very driven and controlled - perhaps there is
          a movement back to a less guided environment,
          something more organic and  exploratory.
        </p><p>
        By stripping features right back, and reducing the functionality, it might be possible to get a browsing
        experience more akin to digging in the crates in an old skool record shop.

        <h5>Self guided - bot resistant</h5>
        <p>
          Free form tags will be the sole information mechanism.
        </p><p>
        No divisions by genres, release date etc

        No timeline, no hierarchy,  no division, no top level recommendations

        <h5>Less is more...</h5>
        <p>
          Restricted track numbers , to force artists to self curate more, to not flood the site with a 20 minute drone track every day of the week.
        </p><p>
        So uploads restricted to simple fixed numbers, for example 20 free, and 40 for patrons, just 2 simple levels.
      </p><p>
        Two to four albums worth of material at any one time, gives some breadth but also is restrictive enough to force people to think carefully about what they are sharing
      </p><p>
        More added per year of membership, maybe like a loyalty scheme, 1 track every 2 months you are a member
        or perhaps bumps on a periodic, sliding scale, 2,4 6, 8 etc

        Filter stream via tags

        User can purchase tracks to store in personal Playlists (tapes), this will be in-app based, so would be at a discounted rate compared to a full ownership download.
      </p><p>
        Enable artists to store sample packs linked to track or album for sale or open source.
      </p><p>
        User can purchase tracks to own - Downloads
      </p><p>
        Suggestion page e.g Daily Top 20 - invite listeners to submit their top 20.  Guest blogs - quality controlled content

              We are building a new hybrid, that takes the best concepts from great soites like Soundcloud and Bandcamp, and builds in this key feature :
              * Implementation of direct (consumer wallet to producer wallet) micro payments  - for streaming, playlists and purchases.
              i.e artists get paid instantly, not at the whim of spotify, tech giants or their label.
              All payments will be purely crypto based, supporting tiny amounts, with minuscule fees.
              We are looking at the Lightening Network as probably the most promising technology in this area, in combination with Bitcoin and Litecoin.

              Our key design philosophy will be, less is more.

              We will strip site interaction right back compared to current social music sites.
              Reducing the functionality to bare bones, encouraging users to engage more, and reducing ability of spammers and bots to game the system.

              The technology around decentralized management of digital assets is in flux - we will research decentralization, and the best way forward
              to hand back, as much control and ownership of content to the artist, as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example Artist has a wallet containing tracks and albums they wish to license. Wallet enables artist to sign and manage licensing
              of digital content,
              They open a channel to YAMS and send the content for inclusion in the site.
              They can flag content as available for on-ward licensing, say for advertising, or for open source content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Investigate options top create a decentralized peer to peer file management system that reduces centralized ownership of content,
              while still enabling content discovery hubs. A community of open source YAMS installations, supporting the network and each other.
