        YAMS is a new hybrid music site, built by musicians, for the benefit of artists and listeners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code is open source so anyone can contribute, copy, or use it to build their own site or service.

    <strong>Hand Back Control</strong>
    <p class="mt-3">
      The technology around decentralized management of digital assets is in flux - we will research decentralization, and the best way forward
      to hand back, as much control and ownership of content to the artist, as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ideal scenario will be for the Artist to control a wallet containing the tracks, albums or content they wish to license.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wallet enables the artist to sign contracts, with centralised hubs or platforms, for the publishing and management of their digital content on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, they open a channel to YAMS and agree that we can publish their content for inclusion in the site, and define within the contract,
      the rates chargeable for download, inclusion in playlist, pay per play etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      They can also tag content as available for on-ward licensing, say for advertising, or for open source content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smart contract contains details of the artists Bitcoin wallet, so we at YAMS can automatically charge customers the amount specified in the contract,
      and instantly forward payments to that wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are investigating options to create such a decentralized peer to peer file management system that reduces centralized ownership of content,
      while still enabling content discovery hubs. A community of open source YAMS installations, supporting the network and each other.
