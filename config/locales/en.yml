        <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide the core functionality of YAMS. You can only interact with other people's private content and post your own content when you are logged in. </li>
          <li>To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.</li>
          <li>The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages,
          and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="spacer" />
        <h3 id="protect">How do we protect your information?</h3>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
        Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm.
        You may enable two-factor authentication to further secure access to your account.</p>
      <hr class="spacer" />
      <h3 id="data-retention">What is our data retention policy?</h3>
      <p>We will make a good faith effort to:</p>

        <p>Your public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and followers-only posts are delivered to the servers where your followers reside, and direct messages are delivered
        to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those followers or recipients reside on a different server than this.</p>
